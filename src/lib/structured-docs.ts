Built using React and bundled with Vite, it provides a fast and reactive user experience.\n2.  **Redux Store:** This component manages the application's state. It holds the chat messages, side panel state, and any other data needed by multiple components.\n3.  **UI Components (Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS):** This includes all the UI components, which are built using Shadcn UI and styled with Tailwind CSS.\n4.  **API Services (RTK Query):** RTK Query simplifies data fetching and caching, managing communication with the backend API.\n5.  **Routing (React Router):** React Router handles navigation between different parts of the application, such as the chat interface, API key settings, and error pages.\n6.  **API Server (Node.js/Python):** The API server is the entry point for all backend requests. It handles authentication, request routing, and data processing.\n7.  **Data Processing & Research Engine:** This component is responsible for processing data and performing research tasks. It could involve natural language processing, machine learning, and data analysis.\n8.  **Database (Vector Database):** The database stores all the application's data, including chat messages, user data, and research results.\n\n### Data Flow Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Frontend\n    participant API_Server\n    participant Research_Engine\n    participant Database\n\n    User->>Frontend: Enters Chat Message\n    Frontend->>API_Server: Sends Chat Request\n    API_Server->>Research_Engine: Processes Request\n    Research_Engine->>Database: Queries Data\n    Database-->>Research_Engine: Returns Data\n    Research_Engine->>API_Server: Returns Processed Response\n    API_Server-->>Frontend: Sends Response\n    Frontend->>User: Displays Chat Response\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Data Flow Diagram\n\nThis diagram illustrates the sequence of actions and data flow involved in a typical chat interaction within Aurora:\n\n1.  **User Enters Chat Message:** The user initiates a chat interaction by entering a message in the UI.\n2.  **Frontend Sends Chat Request:** The frontend application captures the user's message and sends it to the backend API server.\n3.  **API Server Processes Request:** The API server receives the chat request and routes it to the appropriate handler in the Research Engine.\n4.  **Research Engine Queries Data:** The Research Engine determines the necessary data to process the request and queries the database.\n5.  **Database Returns Data:** The database retrieves the requested data and returns it to the Research Engine.\n6.  **Research Engine Returns Processed Response:** The Research Engine processes the data, generating a response, and returns it to the API server.\n7.  **API Server Sends Response:** The API server receives the processed response from the Research Engine and sends it back to the frontend.\n8.  **Frontend Displays Chat Response:** The frontend application receives the response from the API server and displays it to the user in the chat interface.",

Architectural Decisions\n\n*   **Redux for State Management:** Aurora uses Redux to manage the application's state, providing a centralized and predictable way to handle data.\n*   **RTK Query for Data Fetching:** RTK Query simplifies data fetching and caching, making it easier to interact with the backend API.\n*   **Tailwind CSS for Styling:** Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling, allowing for rapid UI development.\n*   **Shadcn UI for UI Components:** Shadcn UI provides a collection of accessible and reusable UI components, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application.\n*   **React Hook Form for Form Management:** React Hook Form simplifies form management and validation, making it easier to create complex forms.\n*   **Zod for Schema Validation:** Zod provides a schema validation library for ensuring data integrity.\n*   **Feature-Based Organization:** The codebase is organized into features, making it easier to manage and scale the application.\n\n### Directory Structure Rationale\n\nThe directory structure is designed to promote code organization, maintainability, and scalability. Key rationales include:\n\n*   **Separation of Concerns:** Each directory is responsible for a specific aspect of the application, such as UI components, API services, or state management.\n*   **Modularity:** The feature-based organization allows for easy addition and removal of features without affecting other parts of the application.\n*   **Reusability:** Reusable components and utility functions are placed in shared directories, making them easily accessible across the application.\n*   **Testability:** The clear separation of concerns makes it easier to write unit tests and integration tests for each module.\n\n### Practical Exercise: Trace a Request Through the System\n\nLet's trace a request when a user sends a message in the Chat Studio:\n\n1.  **User Input:** The user types a message into the input field within the `ChatInterface.tsx` component (`src/features/chat-studio/chat/ChatInterface.tsx`).\n2.  **Message Submission:** When the user submits the message, the `ChatInterface.tsx` component calls the `useStreamResponseForChat` hook (`src/hooks/useStreamingResponse.ts`).\n3.  **API Request:** The `useStreamResponseForChat` hook triggers an API request to the backend using either `useAddQueryMutation` or `useAddSteamingQueryMutation` from `chatApi.ts` (`src/services/chatApi.ts`), depending on if deep research is enabled. The endpoint will be either `/chat/` or `/chat/stream` (or `/chat/deep_think/stream` for deep research).  The `apiSlice.ts` (`src/services/api/apiSlice.ts`) and `customFetchBase.ts` (`src/services/api/customFetchBase.ts`) files handle the underlying API communication, including setting the base URL and any necessary headers.\n4.  **Backend Processing:** The backend API server receives the request and processes the message. If deep research is enabled, it may involve several steps, like rewriting, thinking, and researching, before returning the final answer.\n5.  **Response Streaming:** If `useAddSteamingQueryMutation` is used, the backend sends a streamed response back to the frontend. The `useStreamResponseForChat` hook receives the streamed data incrementally.\n6.  **State Update:** As the data streams in, the `useStreamResponseForChat` hook updates the chat message state using Redux. The `chatMessagesSlice.ts` (`src/libs/redux/chatMessagesSlice.ts`) manages this state, adding new messages or updating existing ones in the Redux store.\n7.  **UI Update:** The `ChatInterface.tsx` component is connected to the Redux store using `useAppSelector` from `hooks.ts` (`src/libs/redux/hooks.ts`). As the state changes, the component re-renders, displaying the new or updated chat message.",

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.\n*   **Code Example:**\n\n    ```typescript\n    // src/libs/redux/chatMessagesSlice.ts\n    import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from \'@reduxjs/toolkit\';\n    import { ChatMessageType } from \'@/types/common\';\n\n    interface ChatState {\n      messages: ChatMessageType[];\n      filterIds: string[];\n    }\n\n    const initialState: ChatState = {\n      messages: [],\n      filterIds: [],\n    };\n\n    export const chatMessagesSlice = createSlice({\n      name: \'chatMessages\',\n      initialState,\n      reducers: {\n        addMessage: (state, action: PayloadAction<ChatMessageType>) => {\n          state.messages.push(action.payload);\n        },\n        // ... other reducers\n      },\n    });\n\n    export const { addMessage } = chatMessagesSlice.actions;\n    export default chatMessagesSlice.reducer;\n    ```\n\n*   **Problem Solved:** Manages the chat message state, allowing different components to access and update the chat messages.\n*   🔑 **Key Insight:** Redux provides a centralized and predictable way to manage the application\'s state, making it easier to reason about and debug.\n*   ⚠️ **Common Pitfall:** Overusing Redux for local component state can lead to unnecessary complexity. Use local state for component-specific data.\n\n### RTK Query for Data Fetching\n\n*   **Concept:** RTK Query is a powerful data fetching and caching tool built on top of Redux Toolkit. It simplifies data fetching, caching, and updating, reducing boilerplate code.\n*   **Code Example:**\n\n    ```typescript\n    // src/services/chatApi.ts\n    import { apiSlice } from \'./api/apiSlice\';\n\n    export const chatApi = apiSlice.injectEndpoints({\n      endpoints: (builder) => ({\n        addQuery: builder.mutation({\n          query: (data) => ({\n            url: \'/chat/\',\n            method: \'POST\',\n            body: data,\n          }),\n        }),\n      }),\n    });\n\n    export const { useAddQueryMutation } = chatApi;\n    ```\n\n*   **Problem Solved:** Simplifies data fetching and caching, reducing boilerplate code and improving performance.\n*   🔑 **Key Insight:** RTK Query automatically handles caching, retries, and error handling, making it easier to build robust data-driven applications.\n*   ⚠️ **Common Pitfall:** Not understanding RTK Query\'s caching strategies can lead to unexpected behavior. Pay attention to `providesTags` and `invalidatesTags`.\n\n### Tailwind CSS for Styling\n\n*   **Concept:** Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes for styling HTML elements.\n*   **Code Example:**\n\n    ```tsx\n    // src/components/ui/button.tsx\n    import { cva, type VariantProps } from \'class-variance-authority\'\n    import { cn } from "@/libs/utils"\n\n    const buttonVariants = cva(\n      "inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-1 focus-visible:ring-ring disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50",\n      {\n        variants: {\n          variant: {\n            default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground shadow hover:bg-primary/90",\n            destructive: "bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground shadow-sm hover:bg-destructive/90",\n            outline: "bg-background border border-input text-foreground shadow-sm hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",\n            secondary: "bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground shadow-sm hover:bg-secondary/80",\n            ghost: "hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",\n            link: "text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline",\n          },\n          size: {\n            default: "h-9 px-4",\n            sm: "h-8 rounded-md px-3 text-xs",\n            lg: "h-10 rounded-md px-8",\n            icon: "h-9 w-9",\n          },\n        },\n        defaultVariants: {\n          variant: "default",\n          size: "default",\n        },\n      }\n    )\n\n    export interface ButtonProps\n      extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {}\n    ```\n\n*   **Problem Solved:** Allows for rapid UI development by providing a set of pre-defined CSS classes that can be easily combined to create custom styles.\n*   🔑 **Key Insight:** Tailwind CSS promotes consistency and maintainability by enforcing a design system.\n*   ⚠️ **Common Pitfall:** Overriding Tailwind CSS classes with custom CSS can lead to inconsistencies and make it harder to maintain the codebase.\n\n### React Hook Form and Zod for Form Validation\n\n*   **Concept:** React Hook Form is a library for building performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation. Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.\n*   **Code Example:**\n\n    ```typescript\n    // src/pages/ApiKeyPage.tsx\n    import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod"\n    import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"\n    import * as z from "zod"\n\n    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"\n    import {\n      Form,\n      FormControl,\n      FormField,\n      FormItem,\n      FormLabel,\n      FormMessage,\n    } from "@/components/ui/form"\n    import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"\n\n    const apiKeySchema = z.object({\n      apiKey: z.string().min(10, {\n        message: "API Key must be at least 10 characters.",\n      }),\n    })\n\n    type ApiKeyType = z.infer<typeof apiKeySchema>\n\n    export function ApiKeyPage() {\n      const form = useForm<ApiKeyType>({\n        resolver: zodResolver(apiKeySchema),\n        defaultValues: {\n          apiKey: "",\n        },\n      })\n\n      function onSubmit(values: ApiKeyType) {\n        // Do something with the form values.\n        // ✅ This will be type-safe and validated.\n        console.log(values)\n      }\n\n      return (\n        <Form {...form}>\n          <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="space-y-4">\n            <FormField\n              control={form.control}\n              name="apiKey"\n              render={({ field }) => (\n                <FormItem>\n                  <FormLabel>API Key</FormLabel>\n                  <FormControl>\n                    <Input placeholder="sk-" {...field} />\n                  </FormControl>\n                  <FormMessage />\n                </FormItem>\n              )}\n            />\n            <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>\n          </form>\n        </Form>\n      )\n    }\n    ```\n\n*   **Problem Solved:** Simplifies form management, validation, and error handling, improving the user experience.\n*   🔑 **Key Insight:** React Hook Form integrates well with Zod, providing a type-safe and efficient way to validate form data.\n*   ⚠️ **Common Pitfall:** Forgetting to handle form errors gracefully can lead to a poor user experience.',
